Long short-term memory (LSTM)[1] is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition,[2] speech recognition,[3][4] machine translation,[5][6] robot control,[7][8] video games,[9][10] and healthcare.[11]
The name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both "long-term memory" and "short-term memory". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus "long short-term memory".[1]
A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate.[14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.
LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed]
In theory, classic (or "vanilla") RNNs can keep track of arbitrary long-term dependencies in the input sequences. The problem with vanilla RNNs is computational (or practical) in nature: when training a vanilla RNN using back-propagation, the long-term gradients which are back-propagated can "vanish" (that is, they can tend to zero) or "explode" (that is, they can tend to infinity),[15] because of the computations involved in the process, which use finite-precision numbers. RNNs using LSTM units partially solve the vanishing gradient problem, because LSTM units allow gradients to also flow unchanged. However, LSTM networks can still suffer from the exploding gradient problem.[16]
In the equations below, the lowercase variables represent vectors. Matrices 
𝑊
𝑞
 and 
𝑈
𝑞
 contain, respectively, the weights of the input and recurrent connections, where the subscript 
𝑞
 can either be the input gate 
𝑖
, output gate 
𝑜
, the forget gate 
𝑓
 or the memory cell 
𝑐
, depending on the activation being calculated. In this section, we are thus using a "vector notation". So, for example, 
𝑐
𝑡
∈
𝑅
ℎ
 is not just one unit of one LSTM cell, but contains 
ℎ
 LSTM cell's units.
The compact forms of the equations for the forward pass of an LSTM cell with a forget gate are:[1][14]
where the initial values are 
𝑐

 and 
ℎ

 and the operator 
⊙
 denotes the Hadamard product (element-wise product). The subscript 
𝑡
 indexes the time step.
where the superscripts 
𝑑
 and 
ℎ
 refer to the number of input features and number of hidden units, respectively.
The figure on the right is a graphical representation of an LSTM unit with peephole connections (i.e. a peephole LSTM).[17][18] Peephole connections allow the gates to access the constant error carousel (CEC), whose activation is the cell state.[17] 
ℎ
𝑡

 is not used,

 is used instead in most places.
Each of the gates can be thought as a "standard" neuron in a feed-forward (or multi-layer) neural network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. 
𝑖

The 3 exit arrows from the memory cell 
𝑐
 to the 3 gates 
𝑖
,
𝑜
 and 
𝑓
 represent the peephole connections. These peephole connections actually denote the contributions of the activation of the memory cell 
𝑐
 at time step 
𝑡
−

, i.e. the contribution of 
𝑐
𝑡

 (and not 
𝑐

, as the picture may suggest). In other words, the gates 
𝑖
,
𝑜
 and 
𝑓
 calculate their activations at time step 
𝑡
 (i.e., respectively, 
𝑖
𝑡
,
𝑜
𝑡
 and 
𝑓

) also considering the activation of the memory cell 
𝑐
 at time step

The single left-to-right arrow exiting the memory cell is not a peephole connection and denotes

An RNN using LSTM units can be trained in a supervised fashion on a set of training sequences, using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent combined with backpropagation through time to compute the gradients needed during the optimization process, in order to change each weight of the LSTM network in proportion to the derivative of the error (at the output layer of the LSTM network) with respect to corresponding weight.
A problem with using gradient descent for standard RNNs is that error gradients vanish exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events. This is due to 
lim
𝑛
→
∞
𝑊
𝑛
=
0
 if the spectral radius of 
𝑊
 is smaller than 1.[15][20]
However, with LSTM units, when error values are back-propagated from the output layer, the error remains in the LSTM unit's cell. This "error carousel" continuously feeds error back to each of the LSTM unit's gates, until they learn to cut off the value.
Many applications use stacks of LSTM RNNs[21] and train them by connectionist temporal classification (CTC)[22] to find an RNN weight matrix that maximizes the probability of the label sequences in a training set, given the corresponding input sequences. CTC achieves both alignment and recognition.
Sometimes, it can be advantageous to train (parts of) an LSTM by neuroevolution[23] or by policy gradient methods, especially when there is no "teacher" (that is, training labels).
There have been several successful stories of training, in a non-supervised fashion, RNNs with LSTM units.
In 2018, Bill Gates called it a "huge milestone in advancing artificial intelligence" when bots developed by OpenAI were able to beat humans in the game of Dota 2.[9] OpenAI Five consists of five independent but coordinated neural networks. Each network is trained by a policy gradient method without supervising teacher and contains a single-layer, 1024-unit Long-Short-Term-Memory that sees the current game state and emits actions through several possible action heads.[9]
In 2018, OpenAI also trained a similar LSTM by policy gradients to control a human-like robot hand that manipulates physical objects with unprecedented dexterity.[8]
In 2019, DeepMind's program AlphaStar used a deep LSTM core to excel at the complex video game Starcraft II.[10] This was viewed as significant progress towards Artificial General Intelligence.[10]
